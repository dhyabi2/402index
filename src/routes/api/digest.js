 * Read payment counters from the partner gateway.
 *
 * The index has no payment ledger — no macaroon, token or settlement table exists here — so
 * every revenue question has to be answered by the gateway or not at all. On 2026-08-03 that
 * gap turned a user-agent slipping below a top-15 traffic cutoff into a reported lost sale,
 * when the gateway's own counters said what was actually true: challenges issued, none ever
 * paid, nothing earned.
 *
 * Failure is reported, never thrown. This block feeds the daily digest, which is how outages
 * get noticed; a gateway that is down is exactly when the digest most needs to still render.
 * An unreadable gateway yields nulls plus the reason — deliberately not zeroes, which would
 * read as "we know, and the answer is none".
