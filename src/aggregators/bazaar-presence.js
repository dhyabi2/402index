// Bazaar presence: which rows the live Bazaar listing still carries (2026-10-27).
//
// On 2026-10-27 the index held ~189k source=bazaar rows against an upstream total of ~85k: rows
// the listing had dropped were never removed. Every full catalog pass now stamps the rows it
// lists with the pass id (services.bazaar_seen_pass) and logs itself in bazaar_passes. When a
// complete pass ends:
//   - active bazaar rows it did not list get upstream_missing_since (a visible bucket)
//   - rows absent from the last RETIRE_AFTER complete passes become status='retired',
//     retired_batch='auto-pass-<id>'
// A pass is complete only if it listed at least 90% of the upstream total, so a truncated or
// rate-limited pass never counts against anyone. Retirement uses status, not provider_deleted:
// purgeSoftDeleted hard-deletes provider_deleted rows after 30 days. The upsert in bazaar.js
// clears all of this when a retired or missing row is listed again.
//
// Storage is one integer per row plus one row per pass. A presence table appending ~85k URLs a
// pass would add ~120 MB a day to a 4.6 GB volume.
